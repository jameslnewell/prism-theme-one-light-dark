This package provides light and dark themes based on Atom's [One Light](https://github.com/atom/one-light-syntax) and [One Dark](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax) themes, respectively. 

*Note*: Due to some limitations of Prism's syntax highlighting, there will be slight differences in syntax highlighting between these themes and the originals provided by Atom.

## Customization

To customize the themes:

1. Fork this repository [here](https://github.com/kenchandev/prism-theme-one-light-dark/fork).
2. Place custom SCSS code in `src/overrides.scss`.
3. Execute `npm run build` to generate the customized themes.

## Preview

Below are screenshots of each theme applied to a snippet of TypeScript code.

For additional previews of other code snippets (Markup, SCSS and JavaScript), download and open the demo files in the `demo` folder.
